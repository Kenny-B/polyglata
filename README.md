# Polyglata - the Polyglot kata labs

## What's this?

An attempt to create more engaging little labs with a twist, and an attempt to implement them in as many languages as we can think of. Why? To learn. As simple as that. **Use TDD**. Why? Because we're convinced it's the only way to create sustainable software. 

This requires us to investigate how unit test frameworks work in non-conventional languages. Yay, more learning!
